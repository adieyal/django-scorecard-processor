Input validation and form creation
- Using XForms
- Generic data store?
-- Project (e.g. IHP results), Question, Data Series (2010 results, 2011 results), Grouping in Series (e.g. country), Value, Version (might enter data multiple times, might need to keep versioned data in a series).
- Questions have validations - what kind of value is acceptable, what isn't?
- Questions have annotations

Transformation and Annotation
- May be simple of complex
May chop data vertically (one set of question response)
May chop horizontally - One question across data sets
May translate a raw value, or a derived value
Traverse dependency tree.

Indicator - tick / cross etc. based on whether output data crosses thresholds.

Output
- 

Reporting from output data
- 


From the other side:
This is a wizard that starts with the:
- Goals and targets people want to achieve
- The actions taken to achieve those goals

Steps through how to collect relevant data, and how to transform that into goals and targets

The mapping may be simple or complex. Re-Action can be a partner in stepping through the process, and helping people identify what is needed.
