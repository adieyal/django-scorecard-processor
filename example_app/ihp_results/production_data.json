For GAVI's cash support, there are no constraints related to procurement, and funds can be used as the country has stipulated in its proposal to GAVI and in line with its immunisation and health plan. When developing the survey tool, it was agreed that GAVI will therefore not report on this indicator.",

However, the bulk of GAVI countries procure GAVI-supported vaccines and related supplies through bulk procurement mechanisms (UNICEF Supply Division, PAHO's Revolving Fund), pooling demand and therefore facilitating reduction in vaccine price and increased stability of vaccine supply.  For GAVI's cash support, there are no constraints related to procurement, and funds can be used as the country has stipulated in its proposal to GAVI and in line with its immunisation and health plan. When developing the survey tool, it was agreed that GAVI will therefore not report on this indicator.",

However, the bulk of GAVI countries procure GAVI-supported vaccines and related supplies through bulk procurement mechanisms (UNICEF Supply Division, PAHO's Revolving Fund), pooling demand and therefore facilitating reduction in vaccine price and increased stability of vaccine supply.  For GAVI's cash support, there are no constraints related to procurement, and funds can be used as the country has stipulated in its proposal to GAVI and in line with its immunisation and health plan. When developing the survey tool, it was agreed that GAVI will therefore not report on this indicator.",

For GAVI's cash support, there are no constraints related to procurement, and funds can be used as the country has stipulated in its proposal to GAVI and in line with its immunisation and health plan. When developing the survey tool, it was agreed that GAVI will therefore not report on this indicator.",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.\nThe Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the \u201csingle stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.\u201d This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.\n\nA key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years. \n\n",

Today 15 capacity building NGO's and 143 Community Based Org are under contract to implement action plans related to MDG 1, 4, 5 and 6. Selcted NGO's take part in policy develeopment discussions such as on Result Based Financing. As lead donor in the PADS basket funding the Netherlands played a key role in supporting this innovative approach from the initiation phase in 2008, making supplementary funding available in the preparatory phase in 2009 and assuring that at least 25% of the un-erarmarked funding in the basket is allocated for financing of CSO action plans.\nThe Netherlands is an active member of the national committ e e for this contractual approach with CSO, which is chaired by the SG Health.\nThe evidence is in the reporting of monitoring missions: The system is operational since March 2010 and the start is promising. It is too early to measure the outcome or impact. ",

In Ethiopia those issues are not fully in place yet. An example of good practices in Delegated Cooperation would be Nordic + Group of donors and its Delegated Cooperation Guidelines where all procedures are clearly stated and jointly agreed.

According to the PFM/CPIA scale which is the one the survey refers to, Burundi does not score high enough to be considered a country where PFM is of sufficient quality to use national systems (Guide to Key Definitions, p.24). Financial reporting procedures in MoH are virtually non-existent. This is less true of the Central Medical Store, which is the one DFID gives financial aid to (from 2010 onwards, we are not imposing separate reporting procedures on the Medical Store, although we do continue to require independent audits because the national auditing systems is judged unreliable (PEFA/Fiduciary Risk Assessment). DFID also provides TA to the Medical Store to strengthen its financial management systems.\nThe Joint EC/DFID/Belgium programme mentioned above should have included a significant capacity building component to strengthen PFM procedures in MoH - this now will (in the short term) be covered by the EC. The explicit objective is that within two years MoH would have sufficiently strengthened its PFM systems that it can 'pass' the EC's 5-pillar audit - so that the EC (and others aligning behind the EC's 5 pillars audit) can shift to use of national PFM systems.

It is now underway, due to be finished  by mid 2011 to coincide with the start of the new financial year (July) and incorporate data from the DHS also due to be available around that time);\n \nii) To support the plan, DFID, the EC and Belgium had planned to pool their funds but this has now ran into difficulties. Individual donor procedures are to blame: \n- we in DFID have for the moment no visibility in our aid framework for Burundi beyond March 2012;\n- the Belgians had internally set money aside for supporting this joint programme through a basket fund (by which they essentially meant non-budget support financial aid).\n- But the EC cannot provide financial aid until a stringent 5-pillars audit of MoH has been completed, and it became clear that if that audit was carried out today, MoH would fail. This meant that in the short term at least, we would have to use another aid instrument if we wanted to keep funding this programme jointly.\n- However, Belgium's procedures are such that they cannot use the money they had pre-set aside for the 'non-budget support financial aid Basket fund' towards another aid instrument.\nAll this has somewhat stalled the process, with each donor extending in the short term their bilateral projects.\n \niii) Efforts are still underway to try and bring these together in a common programme and budget framework, even if funding continues to be chanelled bilaterally in the short term. Finalisation of the sector startegy in the coming 8-months and development of an operational plan to go with it will be key. ",

Naima joints the monthly donor meeting with the MOH. Many civil society organisations are invited to the twice yearly government and donor policy dialogue.   CSO support is the funding of the Malaria consortium (an INGO, rather than CSO). The Malaria consortium was initially contracted to establish social marketing of bed nets - it was therefore a legitimate complementary strategy to governent funding. However the Minister introduced a policy of free bed nets for mothers and children, and therefore the project morphed in to a combination of social marketing promotion and a larger component of supporting a public/private partnership for bed net distribution to health facilities in support of the Ministry of Health campaign of free nets. So, whilst the funding was to an INGO - the programme was for delivery of a government priority of net distribution.",

According to the PFM/CPIA scale which is the one the survey refers to, Burundi does not score high enough to be considered a country where PFM is of sufficient quality to use national systems (Guide to Key Definitions, p.24). Financial reporting procedures in MoH are virtually non-existent. This is less true of the Central Medical Store, which is the one DFID gives financial aid to (from 2010 onwards, we are not imposing separate reporting procedures on the Medical Store, although we do continue to require independent audits because the national auditing systems is judged unreliable (PEFA/Fiduciary Risk Assessment). DFID also provides TA to the Medical Store to strengthen its financial management systems.\nThe Joint EC/DFID/Belgium programme mentioned above should have included a significant capacity building component to strengthen PFM procedures in MoH - this now will (in the short term) be covered by the EC. The explicit objective is that within two years MoH would have sufficiently strengthened its PFM systems that it can 'pass' the EC's 5-pillar audit - so that the EC (and others aligning behind the EC's 5 pillars audit) can shift to use of national PFM systems.

We have our own indicators to measure progress against our bilateral programme's outputs because they are too specific to be included in the unified M&E framework (the unified M&E framework only include 31 or so key indicators covering the entire sector).

It is now underway, due to be finished  by mid 2011 to coincide with the start of the new financial year (July) and incorporate data from the DHS also due to be available around that time);\n \nii) To support the plan, DFID, the EC and Belgium had planned to pool their funds but this has now ran into difficulties. Individual donor procedures are to blame: \n- we in DFID have for the moment no visibility in our aid framework for Burundi beyond March 2012;\n- the Belgians had internally set money aside for supporting this joint programme through a basket fund (by which they essentially meant non-budget support financial aid).\n- But the EC cannot provide financial aid until a stringent 5-pillars audit of MoH has been completed, and it became clear that if that audit was carried out today, MoH would fail. This meant that in the short term at least, we would have to use another aid instrument if we wanted to keep funding this programme jointly.\n- However, Belgium's procedures are such that they cannot use the money they had pre-set aside for the 'non-budget support financial aid Basket fund' towards another aid instrument.\nAll this has somewhat stalled the process, with each donor extending in the short term their bilateral projects.\n \niii) Efforts are still underway to try and bring these together in a common programme and budget framework, even if funding continues to be chanelled bilaterally in the short term. Finalisation of the sector startegy in the coming 8-months and development of an operational plan to go with it will be key. ",

Naima joints the monthly donor meeting with the MOH. Many civil society organisations are invited to the twice yearly government and donor policy dialogue.   CSO support is the funding of the Malaria consortium (an INGO, rather than CSO). The Malaria consortium was initially contracted to establish social marketing of bed nets - it was therefore a legitimate complementary strategy to governent funding. However the Minister introduced a policy of free bed nets for mothers and children, and therefore the project morphed in to a combination of social marketing promotion and a larger component of supporting a public/private partnership for bed net distribution to health facilities in support of the Ministry of Health campaign of free nets. So, whilst the funding was to an INGO - the programme was for delivery of a government priority of net distribution.",

Generally speaking, TA is an integral part of UNFPA funded projects/programmes which usually have a wider scope than TA alone. Hence, calculating the TA costs would require a breakdown of all the UNFPA funded projects/programmes which would be very time consuming. However, as a rough estimate, it can be assumed that around 15% of total financial aid from UNFPA for the government sector is allocated for technical cooperation. ",
