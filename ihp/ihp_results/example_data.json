This indicator measures the extent to which the country commitment on establishing performance frameworks has been realised. PAFs provide a mechanism for monitoring government progress on pre-established priority areas, and opportunities for policy dialogue on key strategic issues for the development of the health sector. They are the basis of a government's policy to make information about the quality and performance of health care services available to the public and partners.  National Performance Assessment Frameworks should be comprehensive (ie cover all areas of health sector performance).",

In determining whether mutual assessments of progress have been undertaken, partner authorities and donors may be guided by the following criteria:\n- Broad-based dialogue \u2014 Mutual assessments should engage in dialogue a broad range of government ministries (including line ministries and relevant departments) and donors (bilateral, multilateral and global initiatives). Government and donors should also consider engaging with civil society organisations.\n- Country mechanisms for monitoring progress \u2014 A formal process for measuring progress and following-up the assessment on a regular basis (e.g. one to two years) might be supplemented, wherever possible, through independent/impartial reviews. The results of such assessments should be made publicly available through appropriate means to ensure transparency.\n- Country targets \u2014 Partner countries have established country targets for improved aid effectiveness and health sector performance including within the framework of the agreed Partnerships Commitments and Indicators of Progress included in the Paris Declaration (PD-\u00a79). They may, however, go beyond the Paris Declaration wherever government and donors agree to do so.\n- High-level support \u2014 The assessments should be transparent and country led with significant support at the highest levels and with an appropriate level of resources.\n\nNB: The survey tool asks whether you have undertaken a mutual assessment of progress.  It is intended that this mutual assessment should be organised by the government, or jointly with other partners - ie not to arrange a separate mutual assessment.\n",

Concrete examples of each category that is reported should be provided:\n\n\u2022\tFinancial support: Funding to CSOs to implement activities, where funds are transferred from the DP to the CSO.\n\u2022\tTechnical assistance (non-financial): This may be through the provision of training, briefing, technical advice but where funds are not transferred to the CSO to implement the activity.  \n\u2022\tLobbying/advocacy (non-financial): This may be through inclusion of commitments or expectations on the involvement of CSOs in programme design, implementation, monitoring etc in project documentation. It could equally be where there is documented evidence that the agenda of meaningful engagement in policy, planning, coordination and review mechanisms has been discussed.  Again the emphasis is on where funds are not transferred to CSOs to implement the activity.\n",
