"h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Welcome to the 3rd annual monitoring of progress against the "
"International Health Partnership (IHP+) Global Compact commitments, by IHP"
"+Results. IHP+Results is an independent consortium of research and advocacy "
"organisations mandated to provide an annual assessment of the results of IHP"
"+.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This online data collection platform has been designed to help you manage "
"the process of submitting data to IHP+Results. If you perfer, it is also "
"possible for you to submit this data through an Excel tool. However, we "
"recommend using this online version as it is more user-friendly, including "
"with the following advantages:<p>\n"
"\n"
"<ol>\n"
"    <li>Your responses will be automatically saved within our database so "
"you do not have to worry about storing and finding multiple Excel files. You "
"will also be able to switch between your response without having to open "
"different files.</li>\n"
"    <li>Participants from the 2010/11 monitoring round will be able to see "
"the baseline data that they entered previously (this will not be editable "
"though).</li>\n"
"    <li>You will be prompted if you enter an unexpected piece of data / "
"information (e.g. entering a number into a text field by mistake).</li>\n"
"    <li>You will be able to directly link through to key terms and "
"definitions rather than have to look them up.</li>\n"
