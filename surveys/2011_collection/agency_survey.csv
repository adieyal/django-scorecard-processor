For this indicator we have provided data on disbursements for the reporting year relating only to grants that were in phase II in the reporting year.
The Global Fund Board has recently (2010) approved a new grant architecture (http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en). A core feature of this new grant architecture is the “single stream of funding per Principal Recipient, per disease.” This means the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient in each disease area, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. This is in contrast to the current model, in which each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement per Principal Recipient, with its own budget, performance framework, and so on.

A key difference between an existing grant and a single stream of funding concerns how funding is committed over time. Whereas our existing grants have funding commitments of 2+3 years, single streams of funding will have fixed regular commitment cycles of up to three years.
